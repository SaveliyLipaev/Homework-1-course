I covered my tracks looking for the hormones of happiness
wrote couplets on the chest in the central part
I was not looking for my style I was looking for traces of a sick dog
everyone who loved me then everyone who waved my fakom
we all wanted to rap rap seconds sound
we were just boys living in those years
I slowly lead to the total slowly across the cells
gel markup of my words without punctuation marks
so that is who was with me then I do not remember you people
pseudo occult music where your lyrics
beyond the fences of our souls blood speck
I found the world once more precisely I understood it
I like when the weather is sad in my windows
hoarfrost settles on black paper-bound evil
I rewound hundreds of times in players and bandages
ethic of terrible know mo on the screen at prime time
broken tv after but playing voice
black room and the smell striking the nostrils
this is not my whole world this is a note
consider me sick but ask for a dose
how can i tell you who i do not know myself
i hear heaven they sing the thunder of the song
and if this is a dream and all that I wrote is just evil
watch me in a knot look into my eyes and laugh out loud
on the cold glass I paint the house
wriggling from the cold of the window frame
I see my face in it, I gave us evil
chasing after itself having found war in a wired wound
But I forgot what it means to live to hear people and heart
closing the private world again keys protests thoughts
I brought up a dream killer
zasrite my wall to and fucking selfishness
and I will tear my voice again, eat people
because music cripples you and me more than a bullet
I will leave with a raised face I will not argue
this music replaced me all but took my mind
and tore to pieces and to the notes
the gills of a torn soul hang in a thin fishing line
these versions under zones verses of the word are a special sort
watch me in a knot look into my eyes and laugh out loud
I somehow became a cassette of new sounds of truth
I am not an artist and therefore I spit on their contracts
I just need a chance that I knowingly passed through the walls
I love the words but they wake the beast in me
I see a room from the windows of dreams the ceiling is so dry there
i am millions call and i got wet and dried
and you want a psycho know I laugh and period
and if i am crazy i need a sheet and pen
let our souls sing and tear the skin to the senses
I handed you the brain in notebooks with a black apostrophe
mr know my i am closing your secrets in the closet
do not bother you anymore know this acid rustle
and I went somewhere dispersing the blood of the aorta
I will no longer cover my trigandetra mattress
this is all focus poku my life in filigramma
with a clumsy hand write the couplet inside the pocket
whose voices go to stall i am in the poles between the currents
and set on fire and in the hair I warm my hands
the former city did not lift itself out of my windows
I caught the words where you found the ambition
i am mr. touchy mr. millions of words
mister watering canister gasoline all evil
and I stretch my nerves playing the harp
without seeing your rhyme-braided afro
remind me of rights don't touch my heart
snow melts on wires and we must return
parts of the continuous mechanism do not move
and leaves the wind to us gnawed faces
and I swallow the world where mp3 gives me a choice
but so far in my pockets are huge holes
I promise to do rap and watch in micro
hello from mr know my people open rob
not an alter ego but a double life by
parapets on carts go letters stained with blood
I am a bunch of crazy thoughts, we have reason to be together
one huge umbrella playing songs under it
table and sediment in the form of dust on repit all night
lay down on the edge of a sick poet was silent and long buggy
and he does not want to talk waving his hands at psychos
cold winters and skinny bitches
rotate the wheel please play with fate again
I urge to tear off your dream from the floor
our eyes will lie to us and not just once or twice
this is not a whiner show but I ask for attention
I tear off the world with pieces of love my voice
I hate my mind in your wounds
I am the result of my freedom a slave to closed rooms
shut this door back today
